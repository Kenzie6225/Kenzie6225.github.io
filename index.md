I am a computer scientist at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4:

This lab had 2 parts to it. The first part was creating variables and initializing units of measurements. Then we printed to the terminal the conversions of each unit. In part two we created a number guessing game. We used if statements to determine if the number was correct or not.

Lab 10:

In this lab I called functions from the header file to create this code. I had to make vectors that would call information from parts of the function in the header file. THis allowed me to print all the counties in California and the population of each county.

Lab 11:

This lab had two parts in it as well. In part one we made vectors that held information about states. We created loops to find the highest and lowest population of states vector. In part two we called functions from the header file to create a class for RandomSecretNumber. We used loops to print out how many guesses were left in the terminal.
